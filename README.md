# Image_segmentation_for_self_driving_cars_using_deep_learning_techniques

This project includes image segmentation for automotive cars using deep learning.This repository includes each little step involved in the project.Firstly,we collected few  real-world datasets and shortlisted one suitable dataset for the project.We have collected KITTI-Object detection dataset,Berkley deep drive dataset,NuScenes dataset by Aptiv,Waymo and Appoloscape.Thus, we shortlisted Berkley deep drive dataset for our project.Then we performed EDA for the selected dataset.

Real world images captured from cities like New York, Berkeley, San Francisco and bay area.Each video is about 40 seconds long, 720p, and 30 fps. The videos also come with GPS/IMU information recorded by cell-phones to show rough driving trajectories.
