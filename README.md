# Image_segmentation_for_self_driving_cars_using_deep_learning_techniques

This project includes image segmentation for automotive cars using deep learning.This repository includes each little step involved in the project.Firstly,we collected few  real-world datasets and shortlisted one suitable dataset for the project.Then we performed EDA for the selected dataset.
